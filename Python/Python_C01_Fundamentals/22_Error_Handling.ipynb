    "# Error Handling in Python\n",
    "Error handling is a crucial aspect of programming, ensuring your program continues to run smoothly even when unexpected issues arise. In Python, exceptions are used to handle errors, allowing you to control the program's behavior and provide informative messages for debugging."

    "## 1. Types of Errors:\n",
    "**a) Syntax errors**: These occur when you violate the grammatical rules of Python. They are detected while the code is being parsed and prevent the program from even running.  \n",
    "**b) Exceptions**: These are runtime errors that occur during program execution. They can be caused by various factors, including invalid data, missing files, or network problems.  \n",
    "**Note:** While error handling, we can handle only exceptions. We cannot handle syntax errors."

    "`try`: This block contains the code you want to monitor for potential errors.  \n",
    "`except`: This block defines how to handle specific exceptions. You can specify which exceptions to catch and provide appropriate responses.  \n",
    "`else`: This clause must be present after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause does not raise an exception.  \n",
    "`finally`: This block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's typically used to clean up resources or close files or connections."
