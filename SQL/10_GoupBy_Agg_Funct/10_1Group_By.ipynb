    "The GROUP BY statement in MySQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. This is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to perform calculations on each group of rows."

    "Like WHERE, the HAVING clause filters the rows of a table. Whereas WHERE tried to filter the whole table, HAVING filters rows within each of the groups defined by GROUP BY.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some rules to follow:**  \n",
    " - You can use column aliases in the HAVING clause, but not in the GROUP BY clause.  \n",
    " Example: SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM sales GROUP BY product HAVING total_quantity > 100;\n",
    " - You cannot use aggregate functions with `WHERE` clause. For this you can use `HAVING`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Summary:</b> If you want to apply condition over all the rows of a table then you can use `WHERE` and if you want to apply conditions over the groups then you can use `HAVING`. Remember, `HAVING` is used with `GROUP BY` clause only."
