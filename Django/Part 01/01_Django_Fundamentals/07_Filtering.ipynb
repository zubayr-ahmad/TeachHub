    "# **📌 Lesson: Filtering Records in Django ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Introduction**\n",
    "Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows querying the database using Python code instead of raw SQL. One of the most powerful features is **filtering**, which helps in retrieving specific records based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Filtering?**\n",
    "- To retrieve only relevant data.\n",
    "- To refine queries and optimize performance.\n",
    "- To apply multiple conditions dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Step 1: Setting Up the Django Model**\n",
    "Before applying filters, we need a database model with enough data to test different filters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Define the `Student` Model**\n",
    "Inside `models.py` of your Django app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Student(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    age = models.IntegerField()\n",
    "    grade = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n",
    "    city = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return self.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Apply Migrations**\n",
    "Run the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Step 2: Insert Sample Data**\n",
    "We need enough data to demonstrate various filtering methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Open Django Shell**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Insert Data**\n",
    "Run the following Python commands in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from myapp.models import Student\n",
    "\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Alice\", age=20, grade=\"A\", city=\"New York\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Bob\", age=22, grade=\"B\", city=\"Los Angeles\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Charlie\", age=21, grade=\"A\", city=\"Chicago\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"David\", age=23, grade=\"C\", city=\"New York\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Eve\", age=19, grade=\"B\", city=\"San Francisco\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Frank\", age=24, grade=\"A\", city=\"Los Angeles\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Grace\", age=22, grade=\"C\", city=\"New York\")\n",
    "Student.objects.create(name=\"Hannah\", age=21, grade=\"B\", city=\"Chicago\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sample data inserted successfully!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Step 3: Filtering Records**\n",
    "Django provides several ways to filter data using `filter()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Basic Filtering (`filter()`)**\n",
    "Returns a **QuerySet** with matching records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from myapp.models import Student\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get all students with grade 'A'\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(grade=\"A\")\n",
    "print(students)  # QuerySet containing students with grade A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Observations**  \n",
    "- `.filter(grade=\"A\")` returns a **QuerySet** with all students having grade `\"A\"`.\n",
    "- The query is **lazy** and does not execute until needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Filtering with Multiple Conditions (`AND` Condition)**\n",
    "We can filter using multiple conditions by passing multiple arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(grade=\"A\", city=\"Los Angeles\")\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE grade='A' AND city='Los Angeles';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Using `exclude()` (Opposite of `filter()`)**\n",
    "To **exclude** certain records:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.exclude(grade=\"C\")\n",
    "print(students)  # All students except those with grade C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE grade != 'C';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Filtering with `OR` Condition (`Q` Objects)**\n",
    "By default, `.filter()` applies an **AND condition**. To apply **OR**, use `Q` objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db.models import Q\n",
    "\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(Q(grade=\"A\") | Q(city=\"New York\"))\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE grade='A' OR city='New York';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5️⃣ Filtering with `greater than` (`gt`) and `less than` (`lt`)**\n",
    "Django ORM supports comparison operators like:\n",
    "- `gt` → greater than\n",
    "- `gte` → greater than or equal to\n",
    "- `lt` → less than\n",
    "- `lte` → less than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(age__gt=21)  # Age greater than 21\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(age__lt=21)  # Age less than 21\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Queries**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE age > 21;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE age < 21;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6️⃣ Filtering with `contains` (Partial Match)**\n",
    "To search for students whose city contains `\"Los\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(city__contains=\"Los\")\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE city LIKE '%Los%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7️⃣ Filtering with `startswith` and `endswith`**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(name__startswith=\"A\")\n",
    "print(students)  # Students whose names start with 'A'\n",
    "\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(name__endswith=\"e\")\n",
    "print(students)  # Students whose names end with 'e'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Queries**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'A%';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE '%e';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8️⃣ Ordering Results (`order_by()`)**\n",
    "To order results by `age` (ascending):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.order_by(\"age\")\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To order results by `age` (descending):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.order_by(\"-age\")\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Queries**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY age ASC;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY age DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9️⃣ Filtering Using `in` (Multiple Values)**\n",
    "To fetch students who are in **New York or Chicago**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.filter(city__in=[\"New York\", \"Chicago\"])\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN ('New York', 'Chicago');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔟 Limiting Results (`[:n]`)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = Student.objects.all()[:3]  # First 3 students\n",
    "print(students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Equivalent SQL Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Step 4: Cleaning Up (Optional)**\n",
    "If you want to delete the sample data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Student.objects.all().delete()\n",
    "print(\"Database cleaned up!\")\n",
    "```\n",
