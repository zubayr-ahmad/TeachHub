I eagerly await your whispers,
Sentences of Rumi's soul,
In scattered fragments of light,
A tapestry I'll make them whole.

From dawn's embrace to fields unseen,
Beyond right, beyond wrong,
Where love's true essence brightly gleams,
A siren's call, a whispered song.

Each word a brushstroke on my heart,
Painting landscapes of the divine,
Where wounds become portals to grace,
And every goodbye intertwines.

So send them forth, these feathered seeds,
On wings of longing, let them fly,
And in their union, I will find
A universe in a single sigh.

In Rumi's garden, where roses bloom,
My spirit finds a sacred room.
With every whisper, every sigh,
My soul ascends, reaching for the sky.

Love and light fill this garden.
